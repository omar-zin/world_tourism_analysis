/* From the last two queries we can the conclued the following:

From 1999 to 2020, Morocco consistently outperformed Tunisia in tourism receipts, despite Tunisia 
having higher tourism arrivals in certain years. This is likely due to Morocco offering higher-value 
and more diverse tourism experiences, even at a higher cost. 

While Morocco saw a steady decline in unemployment and a relatively stable inflation rate, Tunisia faced 
economic instability with higher inflation and persistent unemployment, especially during 
the Arab Spring (2010), an event that allowed Morocco to shine even more in the North African/Arab World's 
tourism markets.

Additionally, Morocco demonstrated a stronger investment in its tourism sector, as evidenced by its higher 
tourism expenditures as a percentage of imports. While Morocco often reached 4 to 7 percent, 
Tunisia consistently lagged behind at around 2 to 3 percent, with only a rare peak at 5 percent in 2018-2019. 
This disparity indicates that Morocco's commitment to investing in tourism likely contributed to its sustained
success and higher receipts, positioning it as a more competitive destination in the region. */
